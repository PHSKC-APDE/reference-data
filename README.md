# ¡¡¡¡STOP!!!!

THERE IS A HIGH PROBABILITY THAT THE DATA YOU ARE LOOKING FOR ARE NOT HERE.

THE SPATIAL, OCCUPATION, AND POPULATION REFERENCE FILES HAVE BEEN MOVED TO https://github.com/PHSKC-APDE/rads.data. Installing that package will allow you to pull reference data with a single line of code. If you've already installed [rads](https://github.com/PHSKC-APDE/rads), you have [rads.data](https://github.com/PHSKC-APDE/rads.data) on your machine. If you want to work directly with the CSV files, go to the [inst/extdata](https://github.com/PHSKC-APDE/rads.data/tree/main/inst/extdata) folders in the [rads.data](https://github.com/PHSKC-APDE/rads.data) repo.
