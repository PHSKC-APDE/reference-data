Composition of HRAs and regions.xlsx = Crosswalks between blocks, ZIPs, health
reporting areas, and regions in King County 
(should possibly be split into multiple csv files to make reading in easier)

KC ZIPs.csv = List of ZIP codes found in King County (includes 98354 and 98422, 
which barely cross into south KC). ZIPs spanning county lines are noted in the two_counties field.
